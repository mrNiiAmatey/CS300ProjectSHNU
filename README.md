# CS300ProjectSHNU
This C++ project, titled “CS300ProjectTwo,” is a course planning tool designed to manage and display academic course information efficiently. At its core, the project leverages object-oriented programming principles and the robust data-handling capabilities of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) to create a user-friendly application for course management. The program is centered around two primary classes: the Course class and the CourseHashTable class.

The Course class encapsulates the essential details of a course, including a unique course number, a descriptive title, and a list of prerequisites. This modular approach ensures that each course object is self-contained, making it straightforward to handle course-related data throughout the application. The CourseHashTable class, on the other hand, uses an unordered_map to store these Course objects. This hash table provides efficient lookup operations, allowing the application to retrieve course information in constant time, which is particularly beneficial as the number of courses increases. ​

A significant feature of the project is its ability to load course data from an external text file. The loadData function reads the file line by line, parsing each line by splitting comma-separated values. The first value represents the course number, the second the course title, and any subsequent values represent the prerequisites. This design choice allows the program to handle courses with varying numbers of prerequisites and to scale as more courses are added. Once parsed, each course is instantiated as a Course object and added to the hash table for later retrieval. ​

User interaction is achieved through a simple menu-driven interface. The printMenu function displays the available options, which include loading the course data, printing a sorted list of courses, and displaying detailed information about a particular course. The printCourseList function gathers all course numbers from the hash table, sorts them, and then prints each course along with its title. This sorted display helps users easily navigate through the list of courses. For more specific inquiries, the printCourse function prompts the user to enter a course number. Then it retrieves and displays the corresponding course’s title and prerequisites, ensuring that users have clear insight into the course requirements. ​

Overall, this project demonstrates effective use of file handling, data parsing, and STL containers to build a practical course planning tool. Its clear structure and interactive design make it a valuable educational resource, providing a solid foundation for further enhancements such as advanced scheduling features or integration with graphical interfaces.
