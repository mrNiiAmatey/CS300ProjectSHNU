In this project, the main problem was to design code using the C++ language and the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE to first correctly read the computer science course data file. The program is a command-line program again written in C++ and will prompt a user to ask for the file name that contains the course data and read that file into course objects that are stored in a hash table data structure. The hash table data structure's purpose is to hold course objects. Another problem was to create a menu displaying the option to load the data structure, print the course list, print course information, and exit the program. A code developed for handling the printing of the course information will allow users to look up a course and print out information about its title and prerequisites. The program prompts the user to enter the course number and prints out the name of the course along with the prerequisite course numbers and course titles. Finally, a code was developed to sort the course information alphanumerically from lowest to highest and print the sorted list to be displayed. 
The problem was approached by first creating a pseudocode in previous assignments. Using data structures to solve the problem helped with code scalability, algorithmic efficiency, and finally, resource optimization which includes memory and data management. In overcoming roadblocks, referring to the course book, researching solutions on the interest, and watching numerous YouTube videos helped.
My work on the project has expanded my knowledge of data structures and their appropriate uses and how to develop code using algorithms. Finally, working on this project has improved my understanding of how to apply algorithms and generate pseudocode efficiently.
